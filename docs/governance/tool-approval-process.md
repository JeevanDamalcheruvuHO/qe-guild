# Tool Approval Process

This document outlines how new tools are evaluated and approved for use within the Home Office QE Guild.

## üéØ Purpose

The tool approval process ensures that:
- Tools meet HO security and compliance requirements
- Teams have clear guidance on which tools to use
- We avoid tool sprawl and maintain consistency
- Tool decisions are documented and transparent

## üö¶ Tool Status Levels

Tools in the QE Guild are categorized using a modified [Thoughtworks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) approach:

### ‚úÖ **Invest** (Recommended)
- **Description:** Approved for broad adoption across teams
- **Support:** Full guild support, templates provided, training available
- **Examples:** Playwright + TypeScript, Bruno, Rest Assured

### üîµ **Trial** (Pilot)
- **Description:** Approved for pilot projects and evaluation
- **Support:** Limited guild support, feedback collection in progress
- **Examples:** New frameworks under evaluation

### üü° **Assess** (Evaluate)
- **Description:** Interesting but needs more investigation
- **Support:** No official support, POCs welcome
- **Examples:** Emerging tools being researched

### ‚ö™ **Hold** (Legacy/Acceptable)
- **Description:** Acceptable for existing projects, not recommended for new ones
- **Support:** Maintenance only, no new adoption encouraged
- **Examples:** Large existing Selenium frameworks

### ‚ùå **Avoid** (Not Recommended)
- **Description:** Not approved due to security, support, or compliance issues
- **Support:** None
- **Examples:** Postman (cloud sync issues)

## üìã Evaluation Criteria

New tools are evaluated against these criteria:

### 1. Security & Compliance (Critical)
- [ ] No unauthorized cloud data sync
- [ ] Can operate in air-gapped environments
- [ ] Compatible with HO security policies

- [ ] Compatible with PowerApps/Dynamics (if applicable)
- [ ] Aligns with HO technology strategy

### 3. Support & Maintenance
- [ ] Active development and community
- [ ] Commercial support available (if needed)
- [ ] Regular updates and security patches
- [ ] Good documentation

### 4. Technical Fit
- [ ] Solves a real problem better than existing tools
- [ ] Compatible with current tech stacks
- [ ] Reasonable learning curve
- [ ] Good integration capabilities

### 5. Cost Considerations
- [ ] Licensing costs (if any)
- [ ] Training requirements
- [ ] Infrastructure needs
- [ ] Total cost of ownership

### 6. Team Impact
- [ ] Skills available or trainable
- [ ] Hiring pool for new skills
- [ ] Tool maturity and stability
- [ ] Migration effort (if replacing existing tool)

### Step 3: Assessment Phase
**Who:** QE Guild Maintainers  
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

**Actions:**
- Research tool capabilities
- Review documentation

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Tool Name - Decision

**Status:** Invest/Trial/Assess/Hold/Avoid

**Context:**
What problem prompted this evaluation?

**Decision:**
What did we decide?

**Rationale:**
Why did we make this decision?

**Consequences:**
What are the implications?

**Next Actions:**
What happens next?
```

## üîÑ Periodic Review

Tools are reviewed quarterly to ensure:
- Status is still appropriate
- No security issues have emerged
- Community support remains strong
- Better alternatives haven't appeared

**Review Questions:**
1. Is the tool still actively maintained?
2. Have there been security issues?
3. Is team satisfaction still high?
4. Are there better alternatives now?
5. Should status change?

## üë• Roles and Responsibilities

### Tool Proposer

## üöÄ Fast-Track Approval

Some tools may be fast-tracked if they meet these criteria:
1. **Microsoft recommended** for PowerApps/Dynamics
2. **Security pre-approved** by HO security team
3. **Critical need** with no alternative
4. **Minor tool** with minimal impact

Fast-track still requires:
- Security review
- Documentation
- Decision log entry

## ‚ùå Rejection and Appeals

If a tool is rejected (Status: Avoid):
1. **Rationale provided** in decision log
2. **Alternatives suggested** when possible
3. **Appeal process:** Contact maintainers with new information
4. **Reconsideration:** If circumstances change significantly

## üìö Examples

### Recent Approvals
- **Playwright + TypeScript** (2023) - Status: Invest
  - Rationale: Microsoft supported, modern features, PowerApps compatible
  
- **Bruno** (2024) - Status: Invest
  - Rationale: Postman alternative, no cloud sync, HO security compliant

### Tools on Hold
- **Selenium + Java** - Status: Hold
  - Rationale: Legacy support only, Playwright preferred for new projects

### Tools to Avoid
- **Postman** - Status: Avoid
  - Rationale: Cloud sync security concerns, not HO compliant
  - Alternative: Bruno
