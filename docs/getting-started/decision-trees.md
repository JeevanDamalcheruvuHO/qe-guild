# QE Testing Strategy - Decision Trees

Welcome to the QE Guild's decision tree hub. These interactive flowcharts help you choose the right testing tools and frameworks based on your project's specific context.

## 📋 Quick Navigation

### By Testing Type
- **[UI Testing Decision Tree](./ui-testing-decision.md)** - Choose between Playwright, Selenium, Cypress
- **[API Testing Decision Tree](./api-testing-decision.md)** - Select REST Assured, Bruno, Karate, or others
- **[Performance Testing Decision Tree](./performance-decision.md)** - Pick JMeter, k6, Gatling, etc.
- **[Mobile Testing Decision Tree](./mobile-decision.md)** - Mobile automation framework selection
- **[Accessibility Testing Decision Tree](./accessibility-decision.md)** - A11y testing tool selection

### Context-Aware Selection
- **[Full Stack Decision Tree](./full-stack-decision.md)** - Comprehensive guidance based on your tech stack, team skills, and project constraints

## 🎯 How to Use These Decision Trees

1. **Start with your testing need** - Identify what you're testing (UI, API, performance, etc.)
2. **Follow the flowchart** - Answer questions about your project context
3. **Get a recommendation** - Receive a tool/framework recommendation with rationale
4. **Review the details** - Check the linked tool comparison documents for deeper analysis

## 🔑 Decision Factors

Our recommendations consider:

- **Existing technology stack** - Leverage your team's current expertise
- **Team skills and learning curve** - Balance new capabilities with onboarding time
- **Project size and timeline** - Different tools for POCs vs enterprise systems
- **Microsoft/HO ecosystem** - PowerApps, Dynamics, and HO-specific requirements
- **Support and maintenance** - Community activity, Microsoft support, long-term viability
- **Security and compliance** - HO security requirements, data handling, air-gapped environments

## 🚦 Recommendation Levels

In our decision trees, you'll see color-coded recommendations:

- 🟢 **Green (Recommended)** - Best choice for this scenario
- 🔵 **Blue (Acceptable)** - Valid option, especially for legacy/enterprise contexts
- 🟡 **Yellow (Caution)** - Usable but with limitations or support concerns
- 🔴 **Red (Avoid)** - Not recommended due to security, support, or compatibility issues
