## 🎯 Tool Selection Philosophy

Our tool recommendations are based on:

1. **Microsoft/HO Alignment** - Especially for PowerApps/Dynamics
2. **Security & Compliance** - No cloud sync issues, HO approved
3. **Active Support** - Microsoft or strong community backing
4. **Team Skills** - Balanced with learning investment
5. **Long-term Viability** - Mature projects with active development

## 🚦 Recommendation Levels

- **✅ Recommended** - Invest and adopt as standard
- **🔵 Acceptable** - Valid for specific contexts (e.g., legacy)
- **⚠️ Caution** - Use with awareness of limitations
- **❌ Avoid** - Security, support, or compliance issues

## 📊 Current Recommendations (2025)

### UI Testing
- ✅ Playwright + TypeScript
- 🔵 Selenium + Java + Cucumber (large existing)
- ⚠️ Playwright + Java (limited support)

### API Testing
- ✅ Bruno (manual + automation)
- ✅ Rest Assured (Java, best reporting)
- ✅ Playwright API (UI + API combined)
- ❌ Postman (security concerns)

### Performance
- ✅ k6 (modern, scriptable)
- ✅ JMeter (enterprise standard)
- ✅ Gatling (Scala teams)

See individual tool pages for detailed comparisons and use cases.

## 🔍 How to Evaluate New Tools

1. **Submit Tool Evaluation Request**
   - Use [Tool Evaluation template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/tool_evaluation.yml)
   - Provide comprehensive comparison
   - Include POC results

2. **Guild Review Process**
   - Security assessment
   - Feature comparison
   - Cost analysis
   - Community size/activity

3. **Decision & Documentation**
   - Record in [Decision Log](/docs/governance/decision-log.md)
   - Update tool comparisons
   - Create implementation guide (if approved)

See [Tool Approval Process](/docs/governance/tool-approval-process.md) for details.
