## Tool Selection Philosophy

Our tool recommendations are based on:

1. **Microsoft/HO Alignment** - Especially for PowerApps/Dynamics
2. **Security & Compliance** - No cloud sync issues, HO approved
3. **Active Support** - Microsoft or strong community backing
4. **Team Skills** - Balanced with learning investment
5. **Long-term Viability** - Mature projects with active development

## ðŸš¦ Recommendation Levels

- ** Recommended** - Invest and adopt as standard
- ** Acceptable** - Valid for specific contexts (e.g., legacy)
- ** Caution** - Use with awareness of limitations
- ** Avoid** - Security, support, or compliance issues

## Current Recommendations (2025)

### UI Testing
-  Playwright + TypeScript
-  Selenium + Java + Cucumber (large existing)
-  Playwright + Java (limited support)

### API Testing
-  Bruno (manual + automation)
-  Rest Assured (Java, best reporting)
-  Playwright API (UI + API combined)
-  Postman (security concerns)

### Performance
-  k6 (modern, scriptable)
-  JMeter (enterprise standard)
-  Gatling (Scala teams)

See individual tool pages for detailed comparisons and use cases.

## How to Evaluate New Tools

1. **Submit Tool Evaluation Request**
   - Use [Tool Evaluation template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/tool_evaluation.yml)
   - Provide comprehensive comparison
   - Include POC results

2. **Guild Review Process**
   - Security assessment
   - Feature comparison
   - Cost analysis
   - Community size/activity

3. **Decision & Documentation**
   - Record in [Decision Log](/docs/governance/decision-log.md)
   - Update tool comparisons
   - Create implementation guide (if approved)

See [Tool Approval Process](/docs/governance/tool-approval-process.md) for details.

## Maintenance

Tool documentation is reviewed quarterly to ensure:
- Version numbers are current
- New tools are evaluated
- Deprecated tools are marked
- Recommendations stay relevant
